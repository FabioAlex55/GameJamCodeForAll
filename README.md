## Overview
CodeBreakers is a Java-based top-down shooter game developed by our team in the span of 10 nights, exclusively during after-school hours as a GameJam challenge. Despite having only 3 weeks of programming experience, we embarked on this project to challenge ourselves and showcase our growing skills in Java. The game draws inspiration from the annoyance of scam advertisements, where players are tasked with shooting barrels that come hurtling towards them.


## Features

**Top-Down Shooter Gameplay:** Engage in an exciting top-down shooter experience, aiming to destroy barrels before they reach you.

**Handcrafted Artwork:** All visual elements, including characters and environments, were internally designed and created by our team.

**CodeBreak Tradition:** The game's title, CodeBreakers, pays homage to our academic tradition of Friday hangouts called "CodeBreak."


## Gameplay
In CodeBreakers, players navigate a dynamic environment as barrels roll towards them. The goal is to shoot and destroy these barrels to score points. The game's intensity increases as more barrels appear, challenging players to hone their shooting skills and reflexes.
